# Plant-Recommendation

## Overview
This repository contains an **IoT-based dataset** for air and soil monitoring, along with a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model** for predictive analysis. The project aims to assist researchers and developers in analyzing environmental data for smart agriculture and pollution monitoring.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes real-time sensor readings of:
- 🌫 **Air Quality (CO2, PM2.5, PM10, etc.)**
- 🌱 **Soil Moisture**
- 🌍 **NPK**

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by adding more sensor data, improving the model, or optimizing the scripts.
